SUMMARY OF TASK : My task was to develop an automated report generation system in Python that reads data from a CSV file, analyzes it to calculate statistics, and generates a professionally formatted PDF report using ReportLab. I successfully created a script that processes 600 records from sample data, performs analysis including average, minimum, and maximum calculations, and outputs a polished PDF report with tables, statistics, and proper formatting. The deliverables include the Python script (report_generator.py), sample data file (sample_data.csv), and the generated report (report.pdf). The project is complete and working perfectly with no errors.
